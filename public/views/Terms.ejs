                        You may close your account at any time by e-mailing <a

                    <p>The centre may restrict, suspend, or close your account on the platform according to its policy
                        for handling copyright-related takedown requests, or if the centre reasonably believes that

                    <p>Between you and the centre, you remain solely responsible for content you submit to the platform.

                        content you submit, and to change it, according to these terms.</p>
                    <p>Content you submit to the platform belongs to you, and you decide what permission to give others
                        for it. But at a minimum, you license the centre to provide content that you submit to the
                        platform to other users of the platform. That special license allows the centre to copy,
                        publish, and analyze content you submit to the platform.</p>
                    <p>When content you submit is removed from the platform, whether by you or by the centre, the
                        centre’s special license ends when the last copy disappears from the centre’s backups, caches,
                        and other systems. Other licenses you apply to content you submit, such as <a

                        may continue after your content is removed. Those licenses may give others, or the centre
                        itself, the right to share your content through the platform again.</p>
                    <p>Others who receive content you submit to the platform may violate the terms on which you license
                        your content. You agree that the centre will not be liable to you for those violations or their
                        consequences.</p>

                    <p>You agree to indemnify the centre from legal claims by others related to your breach of these
                        terms, or breach of these terms by others using your account on the platform. Both you and the
                        centre agree to notify the other side of any legal claims for which you might have to indemnify
                        the centre as soon as possible. If the centre fails to notify you of a legal claim promptly, you
                        won’t have to indemnify the centre for damages that you could have defended against or mitigated
                        with prompt notice. You agree to allow the centre to control investigation, defense, and
                        settlement of legal claims for which you would have to indemnify the centre, and to cooperate
                        with those efforts. The centre agrees not to agree to any settlement that admits fault for you
                        or imposes obligations on you without your prior agreement.</p>

                    <p>If a provision of these terms is unenforceable as written, but could be changed to make it

                        centre that buys assets of the centre related to the platform. Any attempted assignment against
