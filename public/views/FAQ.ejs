                        civilized discussion.</a></h2>
                <p>Please treat this platform with the same respect you would a public park. We, too, are a shared
                    community resource — a place to share skills, knowledge and interests through ongoing
                    conversation.</p>
                <p>These are not hard and fast rules, merely guidelines to aid the human judgment of our community
                    and keep this a clean and well-lighted place for learning together.</p>
                <h2>Discuss and Learn about Project Goals</h2>
                <p>We will be posting projects periodically, and every project identifies clearly what STEM habits
                    does the project address. If the project is not clear, do not hesitate to ask. However, do read
                    what others have asked before asking.</p>

                <h2><a href="#improve">Improve the Discussion</a></h2>
                <p>Help us make this a great place for discussion by always working to improve the discussion in
                    some way, however small. If you are not sure your post adds to the conversation, think over what
                    you want to say and try again later.</p>
                <p>The topics discussed here matter to us, and we want you to act as if they matter to you, too. Be
                    respectful of the topics and the people discussing them, even if you disagree with some of what
                    is being said.</p>
                <p>One way to improve the discussion is by discovering ones that are already happening. Spend time
                    browsing the topics here before replying or starting your own, and you’ll have a better chance
                    of meeting others who share your interests.</p>

                </ul>

                    to be — and avoiding those that do not.</p>
                <p>Discourse provides tools that enable the community to collectively identify the best (and worst)
                    contributions: bookmarks, likes, flags, replies, edits, and so forth. Use these tools to improve
                    your own experience, and everyone else’s, too.</p>

                <p>Our <strong>referees</strong> have special authority; they are responsible for this forum. But so
                    are you. With your help, referees can be community facilitators, not just janitors or police.
                </p>
                <p>When you see bad behavior, don’t reply. It encourages bad behavior by acknowledging it, consumes
                    your energy, and wastes everyone’s time. <em>Just flag it</em>. If enough flags accrue, action
                    will be taken, either automatically or by moderator intervention.</p>
                <p>In order to maintain our community, referees reserve the right to remove any content and any user
                    account for any reason at any time. Referees do not preview new posts; the referees and site
                    operators take no responsibility for any content posted by the community.</p>

                <h2><a href="#be-civil">Always Be Civil</a></h2>
                <p>Nothing sabotages a healthy conversation like rudeness:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Be civil. Don’t post anything that a reasonable person would consider offensive, abusive, or
                        hate speech.</li>
                    <li>Keep it clean. Don’t post anything obscene or sexually explicit.</li>
                    <li>Respect each other. Don’t harass or grief anyone, impersonate people, or expose their
                        private information.</li>
                    <li>Respect our forum. Don’t post spam or otherwise vandalize the forum.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These are not concrete terms with precise definitions — avoid even the <em>appearance</em> of any
                    of these things. If you’re unsure, ask yourself how you would feel if your post was featured on
                    the front page of a major newspaper.</p>
                <p>This is a public platform, and search engines index these discussions. Keep the language, links,

                <p>Make the effort to put things in the right place, so that we can spend more time discussing and
                    less cleaning up. So:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Don’t start a topic in the wrong section.</li>
                    <li>Don’t cross-post the same thing in multiple topics.</li>
                    <li>Don’t post replies with no-content.</li>
                    <li>Don’t divert a topic by changing it midstream.</li>
                    <li>Don’t sign your posts — every post has your profile information attached to it.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Rather than posting “+1” or “Agreed”, use the Like button. Rather than taking an existing topic
                    in a radically different direction, use Reply as a Linked Topic.</p>
